# Introduction #
I converted Northwind from  MS SQL 2000  to MS SQL 2005
after i added some function "to learn others how to avoid some mistakes"
so i create some functions / procedures

# Details #

After created version for MS SQL 2005 i decide to convert
same version to :

- MySQL 5 (using ability of MySQL)
- VistDB
- Sqlite3

and if i've got some time to convert in

- Oracle
- Postgres
- Firebird


so people can switch with easy from one way of scripting
to another one by comparing them "and learning though sample"

so volunters are welcome
